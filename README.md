# About

I am a Research Engineer at Cisco Innovation Labs (Cisco CTO Team). I received my PhD under Prof. Kamin Whitehouse in Computer Science at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville. My PhD spanned the areas of Internet of Things, applied machine learning, wireless systems, mobile computing and cyber-physical systems. In particular, I built wireless sensing solutions that enabled smarter environments (buildings, automobiles, cities, etc) to improve the quality of our lives.
