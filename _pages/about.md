`Email:` avkalyan at cisco dot com (or) ak3ka at virginia dot edu <br/>

I am a Research Engineer at Cisco Innovation Labs (Cisco CTO Team). I received my PhD under [Prof. Kamin Whitehouse](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~whitehouse) in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.virginia.edu) at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu). My PhD spanned the areas of Internet of Things, applied machine learning, wireless systems, mobile computing and cyber-physical systems. In particular, I built wireless sensing solutions that enabled smarter environments (buildings, automobiles, cities, etc) to improve the quality of our lives.

<br/>
`My past life:`
I completed my B.E. from [College of Engineering, Guindy](http://ceg.annauniv.edu/) and my Masters in Computer Science at UVA under [Prof. Andrew Grimshaw](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~grimshaw) on [Large Scale Wide Area Distributed Systems](https://genesis2.virginia.edu/wiki/). I then worked as a Software Engineer for [Zynga](https://www.zynga.com) and [PacketZoom](https://www.packetzoom.com/) before returning to grad-school in 2014.

<br/>
`My other life:`
I am also an avid cricketer, rock-climber, backpacker and an amateur paraglider pilot. I am aiming to visit all countries in the world someday (current count = [46 countries](assets/img/countries.png))
